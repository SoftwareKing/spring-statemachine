# Spring Statemachine Demo

## Introduction

This Spring Statemachine demo is based on a simple turnstile application with two simple states:

* LOCKED
* UNLOCKED

Events that allow transition from one state to the other are:

* INSERTTOKEN
* PASSTHRU

## Building and Running the Demo

This example is built and run using the build tool, [Gradle](http://gradle.org).  At the root of the project, simply execute the command:

`gradle run`

to run build and run this demo.

Enjoy!
